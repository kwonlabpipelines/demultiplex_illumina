## Demultiplex and run fastqc on illumina fastq files


Do you have files from a run that look like this?:


        Undetermined_S0_L001_R1_001.fastq
        Undetermined_S0_L001_R2_001.fastq
        Undetermined_S0_L001_I1_001.fastq
        Undetermined_S0_L001_I2_001.fastq

Use this pipeline to demultiplex the files and run them through fastqc.
